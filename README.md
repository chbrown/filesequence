## File sequences

A `FileSequence` allows you writing to multiple files using standard Python file descriptor read / write functionality.

You specify the file size limit and naming scheme when opening the sequence, but the library handles creating new files as needed.

Each call to the opened FileSequence's `write` function will potentially create a new file, if the chunk you want to write will push the file over the limit. So if you want to only split files on newlines, call `write()` once for each line. If you want behavior more like BSD's `split` command, you can write one byte at a time. Though, at that rate, `split` is probably the better choice.

### Installation

```sh
pip install filesequence
```

### API

You can simply use a FileSequence object as if it were a file.

* `filesequence.open` returns a FileSequence object.
* `FileSequence.write(line)` takes a line and writes it to the next available file.

Note that FileSequence requires `with` wrapping, as opposed to the Python built-in `open()`:

```python```
import filesequence

filenames = filesequence.interpolator('numbers-%02d.txt', xrange(1000))

with filesequence.open(filenames, 1000000) as out:
    for a in xrange(1000):
        for b in xrange(1000):
            out.write('# %d * %d = %d\n' % (a, b, a * b))
```

Now you have a huge multiplication table in 20 different files that are 1MB or less! So awesome!

Want to keep going?

```python
filenames = filesequence.interpolator('numbers-%02d.txt', xrange(1000))

with filesequence.open(filenames, 1000000, 'a') as out:
    ...
```

The 'a' flag will make the sequence jump to the last existing file, and start writing from there.

### Bonus

A `filesequence` script will be installed to your `PATH`. This script reads STDIN line by line and command line arguments for the filename `pattern` and filesize limit (see `filesequence --help`), and writes out a series of files of at most that filesize and without breaking any lines.

* `filesequence --help`

```
usage: filesequence [-h] [--limit LIMIT] [--pattern PATTERN]

Split STDIN into a sequence of files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --limit LIMIT      Maximum bytes per file (default: 50000000)
  --pattern PATTERN  Filename string pattern: generate filenames in sequence
                     by interpolating `pattern % indices.next()` (default: file.%02d)
```

## TODO

* Support reading (flags `r` and `r+`).

## Development

This package is published to PyPI at [pypi.python.org/pypi/filesequence](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/filesequence/).

Instructions for publishing:

1. Convert latest README Markdown to reStructuredText, because PyPI can't handle anything but reStructuredText
```bash
pandoc --from=markdown --to=rst --output=.README.rst README.md
```

2. Increase version in [`filesequence/version.py`](filesequence/version.py).
```diff
-__version__ = '0.1.2'
+__version__ = '0.1.3'
```

3. Commit your staged changes (presumably you changed something)
```bash
git commit
```

4. Tag latest
```bash
git tag -a v`filesequence --version` -m `filesequence --version`
```

5. Push (Github will automatically prepare the static version, if needed)
```bash
git push
```

6. Publish
```bash
python setup.py register
```
