## File sequences

A `FileSequence` allows you writing to multiple files using standard Python file descriptor read / write functionality.

You specify the file size limit and naming scheme when opening the sequence, but the library handles creating new files as needed.

Each call to the opened FileSequence's `write` function will potentially create a new file, if the chunk you want to write will push the file over the limit. So if you want to only split files on newlines, call `write()` once for each line. If you want behavior more like BSD's `split` command, you can write one byte at a time. Though, at that rate, `split` is probably the better choice.

### Installation

    pip install filesequence

### API

You can simply use a FileSequence object as if it were a file.

* `filesequence.open(...)` returns a `FileSequence` object.
* `my_file_sequence.write(line)` takes a line and writes it to the next available file.

Note that FileSequence requires `with` wrapping, as opposed to the Python built-in `open()`:

    import filesequence

    filenames = filesequence.interpolator('numbers-%02d.txt', xrange(1000))

    with filesequence.open(filenames, 1000000) as out:
        for a in xrange(1000):
            for b in xrange(1000):
                out.write('# %d * %d = %d\n' % (a, b, a * b))

Now you have a huge multiplication table in 20 different files that are 1MB or less! So awesome!

Want to keep going?

    filenames = filesequence.interpolator('numbers-%02d.txt', xrange(1000))

    with filesequence.open(filenames, 1000000, 'a') as out:
        ...

The 'a' flag will make the sequence jump to the last existing file, and start writing from there.

### Bonus

A `filesequence` script will be installed to your `PATH`. This script reads STDIN line by line and command line arguments for the filename `pattern` and filesize limit (see `filesequence --help`), and writes out a series of files of at most that filesize and without breaking any lines.

    $ filesequence --help

    usage: cli.py [-h] [--limit LIMIT] [--pattern PATTERN] [--version]

    Write STDIN into a sequence of files, splitting only at newlines

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --limit LIMIT      Maximum bytes per file (default: 50000000)
      --pattern PATTERN  Filename string pattern: generate filenames in sequence
                         by interpolating `pattern % indices.next()`
                         (default: split.%02d)
      --version          show program's version number and exit


## TODO

* Support reading (flags `r` and `r+`).
